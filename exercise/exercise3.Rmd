1. Use again the `daxreturns` data set from the package. Select at least 5 columns as your exercise data set. Fit a
  * R-vine with only Gaussian copulas
  * R-vine with arbitrary bivariate copula families
  * C-vine with arbitrary bivariate copula families

2. Calculate the log-likelihood, AIC and BIC of each of the models
3. Compare the models with the Vuong test
4. Can you improve the best fitting model even further?
5. Can we truncate the model to reduce complexity?
