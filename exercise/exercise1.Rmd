Load from the package the `daxreturns` data set. Select the data for the
companies Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE), BMW (BMW.DE), Allianz (ALV.DE) and Munich Re (MUV2.DE)
Hint: `data(daxreturns)`

1. Prepare an explanatory data analysis
* Are the stock returns correlated?
* Are there tail dependencies?
* Make use of graphical as well as analytical tools. (e.g. `BiCopMetaContour()`, `BiCopLambda()`, `cor(..., method="kendall")`, ...)
2. Based on your analysis, which bivariate copula do you suggest for each of the pairs?
Verify your suggestions statistically, e.g. by AIC, BIC, goodness-of-fit tests.
