This is a page for the exercises offered at the  
**Dependence Modeling in Finance, Insurance and Environmental Science** conference  
May 17-19, 2016 at Technische Universität München 

**Short Lecture: Using the R package VineCopula **
by Ulf Schepsmeier, Technical University of Munich

Vine copulas are a flexible class of dependence models consisting of bivariate copulas as building blocks. The R package VineCopula is primarily made for the statistical analysis of vine copula models. The package comprehensively offers parameter estimation, model selection, simulation, goodness-of-fit tests, and visualization. Additionally, methods for estimation, selection and exploratory data analysis of bivariate copula models are also provided. In the workshop we will introduce the functionality of the VineCopula package by giving illustrative data examples and code chunks. Data analysis, model selection and estimation will be explained step by step. The theoretical explanations are paired with practical exercises. 


The **solutions** of the exercises will be published **after the conference**.
